Hello! Welcome to our brand new ACSS website!

As you can see, we've made a few changes and we're hoping it'll make your experience even better. So we've made a few changes, so let's go through them!

## Mailing List
We've now got a fantastic new mailing list! Now we know we've not been the best at communication, so we want to do a much better job. You can sign up for our mailing list [here][Mail] where you can find out about all the events we do throughout the entire year.


## Slack
As some of you might be aware, we've had a Slack for years where members of the committee have had discussions about how to run awesome events for us, but this year, we've decided to open our Slack to everybody and you can gain access through this [link][Slack] as long as you've got an 'aston.ac.uk' email address.

## Social Media
We've also sorted out all our social media now so we'll be more connected than ever! Our first port of call where you can find out about all our events is our [Facebook Page][Facebook] where we'll be posting most of our events and any external events like hackathons that are happening. Then we have our [Twitter][Twitter], and our [Facebook Group][Facebook Group] where we'll be posting things for members.

## Finally!
So these are all our changes and we hope that you have an awesome time in our society and that you'll feel right at home!
